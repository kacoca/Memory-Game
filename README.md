## Description

This is a memory game project built for the Udacity FEND Nanodegree. A file with some starter code was provided, and it was my task to make the game function. It was built using html, css, and javascript.

##Rules

The objective is to match all eight pairs of cards in the fewest moves possible. Stars are awarded depending on the number of moves used.

##Demo

A demo of the game can be found <a href="https://codepen.io/kacoca/full/BxGObz/">here</a>.

## Dependencies

Font Awesome, Google Fonts (Coda), and Animate.css
